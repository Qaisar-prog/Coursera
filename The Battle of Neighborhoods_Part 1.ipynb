    "That’s what most people say, especially the Californians and the Texans, and that’s when they’re putting it politely. In an early scene of the second episode of __Ugly Delicious__, as David Chang talks about his preferences for tortas and burritos over tacos, the late Jonathan Gold jokingly replies, “You’re from New York. Of course you don’t like tacos. You haven’t had good tacos.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Gold makes the joke knowing it belies the truth. See, there are two major camps of New York Mexican food haters: Folks from out west visiting New York — well, Manhattan — who are looking for the sit-down Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex places where one can order plates by the number, with sour cream, enchilada gravy, and melted yellow cheese. Then there are the people who only want to go to the kinds of places where one orders in Spanish and the tacos come with onion, cilantro, slices of lime, and fresh, colorful salsas; they claim that there’s no good Mexican food in New York because, well, there are not as many __Mexicans__ here to make it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well to prove this wrong and as a part of my project, I will list and visualize all the major areas of New York city that have best Mexican eat outs."
